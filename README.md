# Discord TTS Bot

This is a simple TTS Bot that uses the Google Translate TTS API. With this bot you can send Text-to-Speech messages in multiple languages using Google Translate or other TTS engines.

For more information, visit the bot's [official page](https://docs.moonstar-x.dev/discord-tts-bot/).

## Requirements

To self-host this bot you'll need the following:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Version 16.6.0 or higher)
* ffmpeg

**ffmpeg** should be installed by default on Linux and MacOS, in case it isn't, install it with your package manager. For Windows users, head over to [ffmpeg's official website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) to download the binary which will need to be added to your **\$PATH**. If you don't know how to add folders to your **\$PATH**, check out this [guide](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).

You may also try installing it with:

```text
npm install ffmpeg-static
```

## Installation

In order to self-host this bot, first you'll need to clone this repository.

```text
git clone https://github.com/moonstar-x/discord-tts-bot.git
```

Install the dependencies with:

```text
npm ci --only=prod
```

Or, if you want to also install the `devDependencies`:

```text
npm install
```

After you have [configured](#configuration) the bot, you should deploy the slash commands by running:

```text
npm run deploy
```

Then, you can run your bot with:

```text
npm start
```

In case your bot is in a lot of servers (more than 2000), you should shard your bot. You can start a sharded client with:

```text
npm run start-sharded
```

## Updating

In order to update this bot, you should pull the latest changes:

```text
git pull origin master
```

And re-install the dependencies:

```text
rm -rf node_modules && npm install
```

Once this is done, you should re-deploy the commands:

```text
npm run deploy
```

And you're ready to go. Make sure you check the README everytime you wish to update in case there are breaking changes
that may affect your current installation.

## Creating your Bot Token

Head over to [Discord Application Page](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and create a new bot. Then, you should enable it as a bot
by going into the `Bot` page and setting up your bot. Then, you should head over to the `OAuth2` page and select `OAuth2 URL Generator`. A box should show up
with plenty of checkboxes, enable the `bot` and `application.commands` checkboxes. Then, another box should show up with more checkboxes, enable the following ones:

* Send Messages
* Read Message History
* Connect
* Speak

At the bottom a link should show up, access this link to invite your bot. You should send this link to anyone that wishes to add your bot to their Discord server.

## Configuration

Inside the `config` folder, rename the file *settings.json.example* to *settings.json* and edit the file with your own Discord Token and other settings. If you don't have a discord token yet, you can see a guide on how to create it [here](https://github.com/moonstar-x/discord-downtime-notifier/wiki).

Your file should look like this.

```json
{
  "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN",
  "prefix": "$",
  "owner_id": "123123123",
  "owner_reporting": false,
  "presence_refresh_interval": 600000,
  "default_disconnect_timeout": 5,
  "testing_guild_id": null,
  "provider_type": "level",
  "redis_url": "redis://ip:port",
  "enable_tts_channels": false,
  "enable_keep_alive": false,
  "enable_who_said": false
}
```

You may also configure these options with environment variables. The settings set with the environment variables will take higher precedence than the ones in the config JSON file.

This table contains all the configuration settings you may specify with both environment variables and the JSON config file.

| DISCORD_PROVIDER_TYPE              | `provider_type`              | No. (Defaults to: `level`)  | Can be: `level` or `redis` | The type of data provider to use. [Level](https://github.com/google/leveldb) is a file based key-value store whereas [Redis](https://redis.io/) is a cache service. If you plan on just hosting the bot for a small server you should choose `level`, if you plan on sharding the client `redis` can be a better choice.                                                             |

| DISCORD_ENABLE_TTS_CHANNELS        | `enable_tts_channels`        | No. (Defaults to: `false`)  | `boolean`                  | Whether to enable the message-only TTS for specific channels. With this setting, you can send TTS messages by just sending messages to a channel that you have enabled a provider for. You need the privileged message intent (accessible in the `Bot` page of your bot's application page) for this feature to work properly.                                                       |
| DISCORD_ENABLE_KEEP_ALIVE          | `enable_keep_alive`          | No. (Defaults to: `false`)  | `boolean`                  | Whether an HTTP server should be started. You should only use this option if you're planning to host the bot on something like Repl.it or Heroku. Additionally, you should use something like UptimeRobot to poll the associated address to keep the bot alive. If you need to specify the port to use you should set the `PORT` environment variable (Heroku uses this by default). |
| DISCORD_ENABLE_WHO_SAID            | `enable_who_said`            | No. (Defaults to: `false`)  | `boolean`                  | Whether the bot should prepend each TTS message with a 'User said...'. This makes it so the bot speaks the name of the author of every message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

> If you set `enable_tts_channels` to `true`, you must enable the message content privileged intent in your bot's [application page](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).

## Running on Docker

Before you run this image, you should deploy your commands, you can do so by running:

```text
 docker run -it --rm -e DISCORD_TOKEN="your_token" -e DISCORD_ENABLE_TTS_CHANNELS="true/false" moonstarx/discord-tts-bot npm run deploy
```

After that, you can start a container with the bot's image by running:

```text
docker run -it -e DISCORD_TOKEN="YOUR DISCORD TOKEN" moonstarx/discord-tts-bot:latest
```

Check [configuration](#configuration) to see which environment variables you can use.

The following volumes can be used:

* `/opt/app/config`: The config folder for the bot, here you can use the `settings.json` file to configure the bot if you don't want to use environment variables.
* `/opt/app/data`: The data folder for the bot. If you use a `level` data provider you should set this volume to keep the bot's data persistent across restarts.

## Running on Repl.it

To run this bot on Repl.it, create a new Repl by importing this repository. Then, run the following commands:

```bash
chmod +x init-replit.sh
./init-replit.sh
```

This will set up the proper node environment for the bot.

Then, after you have [configured](#configuration) your bot, you should deploy your commands and start the bot with:

```text
npm run deploy
npm start
```

Make sure to have `enable_keep_alive` set to `true` and use UptimeRobot to poll the address that shows up for your repl to make sure it stays on 24/7.

## Deploying to Heroku

To deploy to Heroku, you can click on the image below and login to your account.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/andrefranc0/discord-tts-bot)

You can now go back to your app's *Overview*, make sure you disable the *web* dyno and enable the *bot* dyno. Your bot should now be up and running. Remember you can always check your bot's console if you access the *View Logs* in the *More* dropdown menu.

If you have `enable_tts_channels` set to `true`, you will have access to the additional commands:

| Command                                   | Description                                                                      | Required Permissions |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| /channel_settings                         | Get the TTS settings associated to this channel (if applies).                    |                      |
| /delete_channel_provider                  | Disable message-only based TTS on this channel (deletes its saved settings).     | `MANAGE_CHANNELS`    |
| /set_channel_provider \<provider\>        | Sets the provider to be used by the message-only based TTS on specific channels. | `MANAGE_CHANNELS`    |
| /google_set_channel language \<language\> | Sets the language to be used by the say and google_say command by default.       | `MANAGE_CHANNELS`    |
| /google_set_channel speed \<speed\>       | Sets the speed to be used by the say and google_say command by default.          | `MANAGE_CHANNELS`    | 

> Up until now, these settings are saved in memory, which means if the bot crashes/restarts, all of these settings will go back to default (`Language: English, Speed: normal`).
